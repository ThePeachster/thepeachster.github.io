                    <p>Welcome to the site! My name is Jason Peacher-Ton. I am a student at the University of Washington currently
                        studying Informatics with a Cybersecurity focus. I am an avid landscape photographer and Ultimate
                        Frisbee player

                    <p>My interest in photography first began as an interest in cinematography. I made various videos over the
                        years but never found the time to improve in that area. My last major project was a video documenting
                        my adventures in Thailand. While I was there, I also found myself experimenting with photography.
                        Out of hundreds of pictures, I came away with a few that turned out fantastic. I had become hooked.
                        It was around this time that I discovered Thomas Heaton's Youtube channel. As I watched more and
                        more of his photography vlogs, I became inspired to get outside and take my photography to the next
                        level. I booked a trip to Iceland for the sole purpose of improving my photography. As a result,
                        I am pursuing photography as far as it will take me. Due to my college budget, I can only save enough
                        money to take trips one to two times a year, so I'm using the gorgeous Pacific Northwest as my landscape
                        photography playground.<br>

                    <p>I found myself gravitating towards landscapes after being forced on a few hikes by my more outdoorsy friends.
                        Mother Earth will never stop amazing me with it's natural wonders and beauty. It only feels right to try and capture
                        how I feel when looking at it. 
                        The excitement I feel when going out for a shoot is addicting.<br>

                    <p>Outside of photography, I play Ultimate Frisbee for the University of Washington Sundodgers, and am a
                        hardcore Super Smash Bros. Melee player/spectator. If you'd like to talk to me about anything, just shoot me an
